CRR exporter has now been added. 'crr.xml' that's been checked into approved directory has
a couple of mismatches in the hiearchy information when compared to the original file,
this is due to the information being incorrectly extracted by the existing CRR importer.
Once the bugs are fixed in the importer, these mis-matches should go away.

CRR exporter currently supports export of an address block (ip block) or the entire
instance file containing multiple instances and address blocks. AGEN parameters are
currently not supported.

Added an additional check for PinTool XML files that were not built with a finalized
ballmap file.
Ensures that USB pins are formatted with the correct suffix (e.g. \_p, \_m)
Example 1:  usb1\_dp  -->  usb1\_d\_p
Example 2:  usb1\_rxm  -->  usb1\_rx\_m

Updated PinTool importer to inlude preconditioning of pins prior to adding them into the
RGen model:
  * Utilizes updates to the RGen pins model so that pin attributes are scoped to pin
function rather than :configuration or :mode
  * Allows the option to sanitize pin information prior to instantiation
    * declaring differential pins and pingroups
    * ensuring TestPort pin naming conventions are met
    * ensuring that pin group indexing (e.g. # of significant digits) is consistent
    * predefining logical pin groups based on bus notation
    * assigning pin attributes:  type (digital/analog), supply, ext\_pullup, ext\_pulldown,
open\_drain, ip\_block

DesignSync wins the prize for the worst revision control system. Unlike 'dssc mvfile' which moves
files in a way that preserves the location for existing tags, 'dssc mvfolder' (as used in the last
release to move lib/configuration to lib/rosetta\_stone/configuration) apparently moves it across the
entire history of the project.

This release has put it back, moved the files individually and then re-tagged. Hopefully this has
resolved everything and not broken the world.

Commented out the spec test "Datasheet data integrity has correct spec information" from
spec/datasheet\_spec.rb, believe this has been broken by recent (datasheet related) changes

This is a workaround.

return a string saying that the real description could not be imported.

A test case was added for the specific fail in question and some additional sanitization
and transformation was added to deal with this specific case, more can be aded as
required as more real life cases are found.

Updated SIDSC conversion to key off of a "multiple\_instances" attribute from a register's owner module, if the method exists.  This allows register names to be made unique if a register map is instantiated multiple times within a module/configuration.

For example, in C40TFS, we have multiple instances of "Core" registers:

~~~ ruby
        def initialize(options = {})
          # Set some flag to tell XML generation to uniquify the register names
          # with the owning component's name, ie: CORE\_ALL\_CORE\_CFG0, CORE0\_CORE\_CFG0
          @multiple\_instances = true

          # ** Core Config 0**
          reg :core\_cfg0, 0x0000, size: 8 do
            # **Senseamp Timing Options**
            bits 7..4, :satime
            # **Read Timing Options**
            bits 3..0, :readt
          end
        end
~~~

When converted to XML via sidsc.rb, any core\_cfg0 registers will have unique registerName attributes (their register id had already been made unique for SSDS reasons):

~~~xml
      <register id="sidsc\_core0\_CORE\_CFG0">
        <registerName>CORE0\_CORE\_CFG0</registerName>
...
      <register id="sidsc\_core1\_CORE\_CFG0">
        <registerName>CORE1\_CORE\_CFG0</registerName>
...
~~~

If a register group does not have the "multiple\_instances" method, register names come through as-is, without modification.

SIDSC export updates:

* Single and double quotes in bits and register descriptions are now automatically escaped
  and therefore preserved correctly in the XML output
* < and > will now render verbatim and will not be converted to an escaped version

IP\_XACT export updates:

* Changed the overall structure from MemoryMaps = Domains and AddressBlocks = Sub Blocks to
  MemoryMaps = The Owner and AddressBlocks = Domains. The net effect of this is that sub-blocks
  are flattened out with the address blocks, need to pilot further with verification to see
  if there are any problems from register naming contention from that.
* Simplified how bit paths are generated by leveraging the latest RGen path API
* Removed the HDL path attribute from AddressBlocks, doesn't make sense now that they represent
  domains rather than an RTL hierarchy

Updated SIDSC register documentation format to allow for unique register and bitField IDs.

This allows the same register and bit names to occur in different register sub-blocks. 
For example, if a module has multiple instances of a single register block, the ID names
will be unique when pulled into SSDS (a requirement for successful documentation
assembly).

Example:

A model instantiates multiple instances of "CoreRegs":

~~~ruby

  options[:num\_blks].times do |i|
    sub\_block "core#{i}",   :class\_name => 'CoreRegs',    :base => 0x1500 + (i * 0x100)
  end

~~~

Where a register "core\_cfg0" is declared within CoreRegs:

~~~ruby

  reg :core\_cfg0, 0x0000, :size => 8 do
    bits 7..4, :satime
    bits 3..0, :readt
  end

~~~

SIDSC conversion now attaches the component name (:component\_name, :name, or
:pdm\_part\_name) to the register and bitField ID attributes.

For core0:

~~~xml

      <register id="sidsc\_core0\_CORE\_CFG0">
        <bitField id="core0\_SATIME">
        <bitField id="core0\_READT">

~~~

And core1:

~~~xml

      <register id="sidsc\_core1\_CORE\_CFG0">
        <bitField id="core1\_SATIME">
        <bitField id="core1\_READT">

Updated to support new Register API features and format/syntax updates:

Added support for "write-one-to-clear" access (bitFieldAccess).

Implemented automated documentation of unused/empty bit positions via empty\_bits (new
Register API function).  Any unused/empty bits in a register definition will be
auto-filled with reserved bits.  Adjacent unused/empty bits are compressed into a single
bit field.  Multiple sequences of unused bits within a register will yield uniquely named
reserved locations.  Empty bit fields currently default to Read-Only Zero access. A future
update may add support for Read-Only One access to be defined on a per-register basis.

Syntax changes of note:
  * registerNameFull has been changed from all caps to simple capitilization
  * addressBlock id has been changed from using :ip\_name or :pdm\_part\_name to
:component\_name, :name, or :pdm\_part\_name.  Use of the same id name for memoryMap and
addressBlock resulted in a naming collision error in oXygen.

Note that some unused fields have been removed: bitNumbers, bitFieldRadix

If you are using the to\_sidsc method and encounter any syntax or nomenclature issues,
please contact Chris Hume at r20984@freescale.com/chris.hume@freescale.com.  To the best
of my knowledge, the TFS FMU design team is the only team leveraging SIDSC formatted XML
for documentation generation.  I only have access to our register maps and .ditamaps for
validation cases.  Examples from other teams would be welcome.

Added Docato workspace synchronizer. This is a wrapping of a 3rd party tool
to upload local documentation to docato.

Will fully document in due course, but basically:

~~~ruby
include RosettaStone

def generate\_block\_guide
  my\_method\_to\_generate\_xml
  rs\_docato.sync(:local\_dir => "#{RGen.root}/output/block\_guide", :docato\_dir => "/my/docato/path")
end
~~~

A method is also provided to automatically return a path to the current user's
sandbox on docato:

~~~ruby
include RosettaStone

def generate\_block\_guide
  my\_method\_to\_generate\_xml
  rs\_docato.sync(:local\_dir => "#{RGen.root}/output/block\_guide", :docato\_dir => rs\_docato.sandbox)
end

Replaced all occurrences of <strong> with <b> in SIDSC content generated from markdown.

Removed the base\_address attribute handling in SIDCS import/export since it clashes with
RGen's existing handling of it - need a real life use case based on SIDCS to work out how
to handle this.

Internally renamed the SSDS class as Docato, since it is really concerned with talking to
the Docato revision control system rather than the more general SSDS.

Fixed several minor formatting issues with to\_sidsc method.  Barring one exception, (noted
below), RGen register content is converted to SIDSC-compliant XML documentation via the
to\_sidsc method.

Exception: markdown-style bolded text, ex: **this is to be bold**, is incorrectly
bookended with <strong><strong/>.  This will be corrected to <b><b/> in the next release.

Added direct import from SSDS. This currently only works on Windows until the Linux Ruby
installation is updated and will not be documented on the main page until then, but here
is an example:

~~~ruby
# Instead of supplying a path to a local file an SSDS ID and version can be supplied instead
rs\_import(:ssds\_id => , :version => 60)
~~~

RGen will fetch and cache the corresponding XML file in a similar way to how imports are handled.

Also added an initial module to generate C headers, this adds a to\_header method which will
currently generate a default header format for the modules registers:

~~~ruby
$dut.pmc.to\_header
~~~

This is an initial tag of a new RGen plugin to provide import/export APIs to
interface with other Freescale tools.

For example the import APIs will allow register, pin and spec data that is
mastered somewhere else to be automatically imported and instantiated for use
within an RGen environment.

The export APIs will support the case where RGen is being used to master this
type of data as is currently being piloted by the NVM design team.

Many formats may ultimately be supported but initially the goal is to support
SIDSC (SSDS) and API-Factory.

This initial release fully supports importing SIDSC register data and has a
passing test case which imports registers for the ATX uC module from SSDS.

The public facing API is still in development and will be documented in due
course.
