## Environment

--------------

### Installation

Follow the steps below to setup a new environment.

#### 1. Install RGen

Follow these instructions to install RGen: [How to Install RGen](http://rgen.freescale.net/rgen/latest/guides/starting/installing)

After this you do not need to touch the RGen workspace again, the <%= RGen.config.name %> application will
monitor your RGen installation and will prompt for any additional action that needs to be taken
in the future - typically when to populate to a newer version.

#### 2. Create the <%= RGen.config.name %> workspace

This workspace must be situated outside of the RGen workspace that you have just created.

Execute the following commands, substituting my_workspace for whatever name you like:

~~~
mkdir my_workspace
cd my_workspace
dssc setvault <%= RGen.config.vault %> .
dssc pop -rec -uni -force -ver <%= RGen.app.version %> .
~~~

% end
