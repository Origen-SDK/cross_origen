## IP-XACT Export

This page shows IP-XACT formatted XML that has been generated from an Origen
representation of a module.

The exporter has the following options:

* **:format** - nil by default, can be set to :uvm to include the associated vendor
  extentions
* **:include_bit_field_values** - true by default, when false the bit field values 
  fields will not be output

The code to generate this page was simply:

~~~eruby
<%= "<" + "%= $dut.to_ip_xact format: :uvm %" + ">" %>
~~~

~~~xml
<%= $dut.to_ip_xact format: :uvm %>
~~~

% end
