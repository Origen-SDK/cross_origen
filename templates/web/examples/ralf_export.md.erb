## RALF Export

This page shows RALF (Synopsys) formatted output that has been generated from an Origen
representation of a module.

The Origen model itself was populated by the SIDSC import
code shown in the 
[SIDSC Import](<%= path "examples/sidsc_import" %>) example.

The code to generate this page was simply:

~~~eruby
<%= "<" + "%= $dut.to_ralf %" + ">" %>
~~~

~~~text
<%= $dut.sidsc_module.to_ralf %>
~~~

% end
